# Token Crowdsale

![alt=""](Images/application-image.png)

# Description

For this project, I am tasked with developing a monetary system for a new Mars colony by creating a KaseiCoin token contract, a KaseiCoin crowdsale contract and a KaseiCoin deployer contract. For testing, I will deploy on a local blockchain. KaseiCoin will be a fungible token and will be ERC-20 compliant. The purpose of this crowdsale is to convert earthling money to KaseiCoin.
